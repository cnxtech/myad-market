# MYAD Market

Online commerce presents buyers with a vast world of convenience and speed, however the current leading online art marketplaces are not very beneficial for sellers.  As more commerce transitions online, it is only natural that disintermediation will reach art marketplaces. Companies like Etsy and eBay are making a large profit on small and big artists alike.  Not only are they taking cuts from every sale, but they are introducing layers of friction that can be removed with blockchain and NFTs.  Myad Market creates an efficient peer-to-peer marketplace for artists to sell directly to buyers in a more open and equitable way. 

MYAD Market allows anyone to mint their own artwork and auction it off directly to consumers on the blockchain, increasing transparency while delivering more money back to the original artist.  

The following code contains two contracts: ArtAuction.sol and ArtMarket.sol. ArtAuction contains code to execute each individual auction including functionality for bidding, withdrawing bids, auction timers, transfering funds and reseting the auction if necessary.  ArtMarket includes the functionality of ArtAuction as well as the marketplace including creating auctions, registering art, ending auctions, shipping, returning art and customer satisfaction.

This platform allows for the safe registration, sale, and transfer of physical artwork online through a digital marketplace.  There are many potential applications beyond artwork.  This method can be efficiently applied to the sale and transfer of anything online.  This allows for disintermediation as well as increased transparency, traceability, security, privacy and speed at a low cost for all users of the marketplace blockchain.
